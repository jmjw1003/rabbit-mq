# rabbit-mq

A series of scripts to demonstrate Rabbit Message Queue usage in Python.

Note: Assumption is that you already have RabbitMQ set up and running locally prior to executing the scripts.

## Requirements

- Pika Python client (queues)
- rstream (...do I need to say it?)
- Everything here was written in Python 3.12 so you might have issues running an older version
